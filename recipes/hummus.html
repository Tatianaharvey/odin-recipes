        <p>Can hummus get anymore beautiful then this dish?</p>
        <p>A delicious blend of lemon, garlic and olive oil, with the colorful and nourishing aspects of beets, really step up this hummus dish to be the ultimate appetizer or snack!</p>
        <p>Pair it with chopped up fresh vegetables, such as cucumbers, peppers, and carrots, or spread it on toast with fresh, sliced avocado for an outstanding open-faced sandwich! And don't worry to my fellow millenials out there, you won't break the bank with this avocado and hummus toast.</p>
